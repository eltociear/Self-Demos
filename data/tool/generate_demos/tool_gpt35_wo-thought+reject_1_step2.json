The impacts of climate change are wide-ranging and include rising global temperatures, melting glaciers, sea-level rise, more frequent and intense heatwaves and storms, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity. Climate change also poses significant risks to human health, food security, water resources, and economic stability. Mitigating climate change requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, enhancing climate resilience, and promoting sustainable practices. The international community has recognized the urgency of addressing climate change and has committed to collective action through global agreements like the Paris Agreement. By taking decisive action now, we can mitigate the worst impacts of climate change and create a more sustainable future for generations to come.')\"]"
