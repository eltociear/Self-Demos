      "Question: A particular right pyramid has a square base, and each edge of the pyramid is four inches long. What is the volume of the pyramid in cubic inches? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\n",
      "Answer: The base has area $B=4\\cdot 4=16.$  The length of the segment connecting a vertex of the base to the center of the base equals $\\sqrt{2^2+2^2}=2\\sqrt{2}.$   This segment and the altitude of the pyramid form a right triangle with hypotenuse of length $4$.  Thus we have $h=\\sqrt{4^2-(2\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{8}$.  By the volume formula for a pyramid, we have $V=Bh/3=16\\sqrt{8}/3\\approx \\boxed{15.08}$ cubic inches.\n",

      "Question: At a school, all 60 students play on at least one of three teams: Basketball, Soccer, and Mathletics. 8 students play all three sports, half the students play basketball, and the ratio of the size of the math team to the size of the basketball team to the size of the soccer team is $4:3:2$. How many students at the school play on exactly two teams?\n",
      "Answer: We have enough information to solve for the size of each team. There are $\\dfrac{60}{2}=30$ members of the basketball team, $\\dfrac{4}{3}(30)=40$ members of the math team, and $\\dfrac{2}{3}(30)=20$ members of the soccer team. Adding these up gives us 90, so clearly we're overcounting since there are only 60 students. The number of times that each student is counted in this total is equal to the number of teams that student plays on. This means that all 60 students will be counted at least once, all students who play exactly two sports will be counted one extra time, and all students who play three sports will be counted two extra times. Letting $x$ be the number of students who play two sports and $y$ be the number who play all three gives us $60+x+2y=90$. However, we know that $y=8$, so we can substitute that in and get $x=\\boxed{14}$.\n",

      "Question: The four-digit number $25AB$ is divisible by nine, with $A$ the tens digit and $B$ the units digit. How many different such four-digit numbers could $25AB$ represent?\n",
      "Answer: Since $2+5=7$ and $2+5+A+B$ is divisible by 9, $A+B$ must be at least 2. Therefore, the least multiple of 9 greater than 2500 is 2502.  We may add multiples of 9 to 2502 to obtain all the multiples of 9 between 2500 and 2600, and 90 is the greatest multiple of 9 we may add without exceeding 2600.  In other words, the multiples of 9 between 2500 and 2600 are the integers of the form $2502+9k$, where $k$ ranges from 0 to 10.  There are $\\boxed{11}$ values of $k$ between 0 and 10 inclusive.\n",

      "Question: A particular right pyramid has a square base, and each edge of the pyramid is four inches long. What is the volume of the pyramid in cubic inches? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\n",
      "Answer: The base has area $B=4\\cdot 4=16.$  The length of the segment connecting a vertex of the base to the center of the base equals $\\sqrt{2^2+2^2}=2\\sqrt{2}.$   This segment and the altitude of the pyramid form a right triangle with hypotenuse of length $4$.  Thus we have $h=\\sqrt{4^2-(2\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{8}$.  By the volume formula for a pyramid, we have $V=Bh/3=16\\sqrt{8}/3\\approx \\boxed{15.08}$ cubic inches.\n",
